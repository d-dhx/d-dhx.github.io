Hi! Welcome to my personal website.
I'm Diane.

I’m pursuing dual degrees at Carnegie Mellon University, combining my interests across both the technical and human-centered domains. I'm a [BCSA](https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/bcsa.html) student, which is an interdisciplinary program blending Computer Science and Architecture, and I'm also majoring in [Cognitive Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/undergraduate/prospective-students/academics/cognitive-science/index.html) through the Department of Psychology.

Through the BCSA program, I've had the opportunity to explore the intersection of design, computation, and spatial thinking—building a foundation in both architectural theory and computer science principles. At the same time, my studies in Cognitive Science allow me to dive into how people think, learn, and interact with technology, bridging insights from psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

Together, these programs reflect my curiosity and passion for connecting ideas across disciplines—bringing together the analytical, the creative, and the humanistic in my academic journey.
